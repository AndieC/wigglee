# Wigglee

A Covid-19 inspired fitness app for elementary school aged children to incentivize regular physical fitness.

_"We know that kids don't want to do it, so our goal is to give them the incentive!"_

A family friendly app that uses machine learning to keep the kids accountable by recognizing their movements and unlocking daily points toward incentives on behalf of their participation.
Wigglee allows an adult user to create an account and add their children. The child user can select an exercise, workout, and view their accumulated points. A list of incentives is determined by the adult user and presented to the child so that they may choose which reward they want to work towards.
