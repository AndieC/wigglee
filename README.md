# Aphrodite - Capstone

A Covid-19 inspired fitness app for elementary school aged children to incentivize regular physical fitness.

_"We know that kids don't want to do it, so our goal is to give them the incentive!"_

A family friendly app that uses machine learning to keep the kids accountable by recognizing their movements and unlocks daily points for incentives on behalf of their participation.
It allows a grown up to sign up for an account and add their children. The children are able to select the exercises and view their daily and lifetime points which they can then trade for rewards with their grownups.
